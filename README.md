## Project Description
* This is Taskmanager App Frontend part.
* It's the frontend part of the whole project.
* It goes along with backend part taskmanager_spring repository.
* Backend server must be run before frontend server.

* Node and npm https://nodejs.org/en/

## Running taskmanager_vue locally
In this section, you will clone an existing Vue.js application and run it locally:
* Open a terminal window;
* -cd to folder you already created when cloning taskmanager_spring app: Taskmanager;
* -Clone the Vue.js taskmanager_vue project into the Taskmanager directory by typing:
```
git clone https://github.com/aarekaarid/taskmanager_vue.git
```
* Now you should have both parts of the project in the same place;
* cd into folder taskmanager_vue;
